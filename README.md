### rustls is string or &str and file to payload

```text
This library is used for string and file loading. 

The current rustls-pemfile can only parse file loading

so it is very inconvenient

Of course,load is not fully working yet,

and I am learning the rustls-pemfile parsing process and the string forms that need to be processed.

```

#### Use cases, please refer to: examples
